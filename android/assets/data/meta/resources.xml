    This file is used to list the resource you need to load at startup
    Of course, if you write your own custom loader for the libgdx assetmanager,
    it will also work (but you have to register the loader into the asset manager manually currently)
    (See ResourceManager.init())

    <!--
    With resolver = true, means that according to the device used, the loaded resource
    will be loaded from either data/gfx/hd or data/gfx/md or data/gfx/sd according to
    the device graphic capabilities (Some device may not be able to load 2048px textures
    for example.)
